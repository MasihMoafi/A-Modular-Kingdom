# Project Tasks & Ideas

## Current A-Modular-Kingdom Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Upgrade memory system to use RAG's advanced retrieval instead of simple similarity search
- [ ] Update README.md files in agent/ and memory/ directories
- [ ] Clean up test files (remove rag_debug_test.py, evaluate rag_v3_standalone_test.py)

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Add TTS/STT capabilities
- [ ] Add UI and multi-modal support (image handling via different base model)
- [ ] Integrate Playwright MCP for web automation
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams and documentation

## Integration Projects

### Multi-Agent Hierarchical System
- **King (User)** → **Queen (Juliette - Router)** → **Teacher + Code Agent**
- Queen has TTS/STT, erotic personality 
- Teacher supervises code agent (uses smolagents)
- Both agents have code execution + web search tools

### Other Existing Projects
- [ ] Gym plan generator (CrewAI-based)
- [ ] Multi-modal projects with different base models
- [ ] Research agent following Anthropic's deep research architecture
- [ ] Hackathon project requiring RAG + memory + multi-agent setup

## Research & Learning
- [ ] Compare custom agents vs LangGraph approaches
- [ ] Implement unfinished research paper in code
- [ ] Fine-tune diffusion model on custom dataset

## Documentation & Organization
- [ ] Generate architecture diagrams for all projects
- [ ] Create clean git repositories for each project
- [ ] Document modular integration approaches
