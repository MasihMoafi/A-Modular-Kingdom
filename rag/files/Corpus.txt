<note title="Case A">
[CHUNK J-1]
The premise of this history is to examine a philosophical question: If we respect social conventions and laws, why is our path filled with thorns, while the path of the wicked is strewn with flowers? Some conclude that it is better to go with the flow. In a century where corruption prevails, the safest course is to act as others do. Will they not say that virtue is the worst choice available?
[CHUNK J-2]
Two sisters, Juliette and Justine, were the daughters of a prominent Parisian banker. They were raised in a convent with the finest education. Juliette, the elder, was pragmatic and amoral. Justine, twelve years old, was serious, melancholic, and possessed of a surprising sensitivity. Upon their parents' death and the family's bankruptcy, they were cast out of the convent with only one hundred écus each.
[CHUNK J-3]
Juliette told Justine that in this world, one must only be concerned with physical sensations that can silence all moral feelings. She argued that their beauty was a tool for survival and that they should surrender to libertine pleasures rather than suffer. Justine was horrified by this philosophy and chose to separate from her sister, preferring death to dishonor.
[CHUNK J-4]
Justine's first attempt at seeking help was from her mother's former seamstress. The woman, who had once loved her, barely recognized her and threw her out violently. Justine realized: "In this world, people's respect is measured only by the interest they can gain from you."
[CHUNK J-5]
Justine next sought help from a parish priest. She explained her desperate situation. The priest, looking at her with lecherous eyes, offered her a pittance for food if she would agree to "serve" him, placing his hand between her breasts. When she refused, declaring that his price for charity was too high, he became ashamed and threw her out.
[CHUNK J-6]
In contrast, Juliette went to a procuress named Duvergier. She was praised for her shamelessness. Duvergier took her money and taught her the trade: be clean, be discreet with colleagues, and be cunning with men. Her virginity was sold a hundred times over four months, with Duvergier performing repairs after each transaction. She quickly became a formal member of the establishment.
[CHUNK J-7]
Juliette's success grew. Within four years, she had seduced six powerful men. To secure an inheritance from the Comte de Lorsange, she secretly poisoned him. She later committed two more murders for financial gain and performed several abortions to preserve her figure and reputation. She amassed a fortune, jewels, and several houses.
[CHUNK J-8]
Justine met Monsieur Dubourg, one of the wealthiest merchants in the capital. He told her: "Virtue is of no use in the world. It cannot fill your stomach. A man values in a woman only what he can get for his money or for his pleasure. We derive no benefit from a woman's virtue." He argued that honesty and benevolence were dead, replaced by the more tangible pleasures gained from others.
[CHUNK J-9]
Dubourg's philosophy continued: "What does it matter if a few people are eliminated? France has more subjects than it needs. Bastards, orphans, and malformed children should be killed at birth. They are leeches on society. These houses of charity are a food source for these parasites."
[CHUNK J-10]
Dubourg attempted to assault Justine. Her tears and suffering only excited him more. She managed to escape and returned to her landlady, Madame Desroches. Instead of sympathy, the landlady berated her: "Do you imagine men are foolish enough to give charity to a girl like you without getting something in return? You will satisfy him and bring me money, or I will have you thrown in prison."
[CHUNK J-11]
Forced to return, Justine was again assaulted by Dubourg. He stripped her naked, but his extreme depravity caused him to become impotent before he could violate her. Furious, he blamed her for his failure, gave her only enough money to pay her landlady's debt, and made her promise to return the next day. Justine paid the debt and fled, vowing never to return. A week later, she learned Dubourg had received a new government post, increasing his income by over four hundred thousand livres a year.
[CHUNK J-12]
Justine found employment with Monsieur du Harpin, a notorious miser. Her duties were immense, and her rations were meager: three ounces of bread a day and water from the stream. To avoid buying powder for his wig, Harpin had Justine scrape plaster off the walls, which was then ground into a fine dust for use.
[CHUNK J-13]
Harpin attempted to force Justine to steal a box of jewels from a wealthy neighbor. He delivered a speech on the utility of theft for re-establishing balance in the unequal distribution of wealth. He argued that it required courage and skill, and that out of twenty thieves, only two are ever condemned.
[CHUNK J-14]
Justine refused to commit the theft, proclaiming her virtue. Harpin pretended it was only a test. A month later, he planted a stolen diamond ring under her mattress and had her arrested by the police. At her trial, her poverty was seen as proof of guilt. Her defense was dismissed, and she was sentenced to be hanged.
[CHUNK J-15]
In prison, Justine met a famous criminal named Dubois. Just before their execution day, Dubois organized a fire. Twenty-one people burned to death, but Justine and Dubois escaped into the forest.
[CHUNK J-16]
Dubois advised Justine: "Abandon the path of virtue. As you can see, it has never brought you success. An ill-timed delicacy brought you to the gallows, while a heinous crime saved me from it. You are young and pretty. Give me two years, and I guarantee I will make you rich, though not through the paths of virtue."
[CHUNK J-17]
Justine refused, declaring her faith in Providence and the rewards of the afterlife. Dubois mocked her: "Believe me, you must set aside God's justice, his punishments, or his rewards. The hard hearts of the rich justify the bad conduct of the poor. If their purses were open to our needs, virtue would flourish in our hearts. But as long as our misery only tightens our chains, our wickedness will serve them."
[CHUNK J-18]
Dubois's four male accomplices, drunk and lustful, decided to rape Justine. To save herself from violation, she was forced to agree to join their gang. The leader, Rodin, proposed a compromise: Justine would strip naked and submit to their desires in non-penetrative ways, while Dubois serviced them to completion. Justine was forced to endure four separate acts of extreme degradation.
[CHUNK J-19]
The gang committed a highway robbery, murdering three men for a small sum of money. Dubois justified it: "The value of anything should only be calculated in relation to our own interest. The loss of each of our victims is of no value compared to our own lives. A truly vigorous individual knows he must place himself above others. The greatest injuries he inflicts are less of an affliction to him than the smallest pleasure he procures for himself at the price of those injuries."
[CHUNK J-20]
Justine argued against this philosophy, stating that society relies on an exchange of good deeds. Rodin countered: "It is not virtue that binds criminals, but self-interest. The common interest of a society is just the sum of individual interests. What does a person who has nothing have to cede? For him, a pact with society is a fool's bargain. The true sage is he who, with all his strength, flouts this pact."
[CHUNK J-21]
Rodin delivered a speech against the existence of God, calling him a phantom born of ignorance and fear, and religion a tool for the powerful to enslave the weak. He concluded: "No, Justine, there is no God, nature is sufficient unto herself. We are simply a small part of a base and crude matter, and when we die, we are gone forever, no matter how we have behaved."
[CHUNK J-22]
The gang captured a wealthy merchant from Lyon named Saint-Florent. They took his valuables and prepared to kill him. To save his life, Justine pretended he was her relative and promised Rodin she would submit to his desires. Saint-Florent, stunned, agreed to join the gang to save himself.
[CHUNK J-23]
While the gang slept, Justine helped Saint-Florent escape, returning his wallet of promissory notes. Overcome with gratitude, Saint-Florent offered her marriage and his fortune. Justine refused, asking only to be taken to Lyon and found a place with an honest family.
[CHUNK J-24]
Saint-Florent led Justine into a forest. Suddenly, he struck her with a stick, knocking her unconscious. When she awoke hours later, she had been brutally raped, beaten, and robbed of the very money she had saved. Her clothes were torn, and she was left for dead. This was her reward for saving his life and fortune.
[CHUNK J-25]
The next day, Justine witnessed two men—the Comte de Bressac and his valet Jasmin—engaged in homosexual acts. They discovered her hiding. Bressac, a man who loathed women, had them tie her spread-eagled to four trees as a punishment. He then offered to take her into the service of his aunt, threatening to kill her if she ever betrayed him.
[CHUNK J-26]
Bressac revealed to Justine his plan to poison his aunt for her inheritance. He delivered a long philosophical justification for murder, arguing that destruction is merely a form of transformation that serves nature's laws. "He who destroys the most," he said, "is he who has served her the best. The continuity of crime is the primary law that sets nature in motion."
[CHUNK J-27]
Justine, pretending to agree to the plan, instead warned the aunt. Bressac discovered the betrayal. He lured Justine back to the same spot in the forest, stripped her, tied her to a tree, and set three monstrous hunting dogs on her, which mauled her horribly. The sight of her suffering excited him. He then told her she would be framed for the aunt's murder and cast her out.
[CHUNK J-28]
Justine found refuge with a surgeon named Rodin. His house was also a school for beautiful children, whom he used for his sadistic libertine pleasures. His passion was to whip them. Justine, hiding, witnessed him punish boys and girls under false pretenses, deriving intense excitement from their tears and the blood he drew. His climax was achieved only through their suffering.
[CHUNK J-29]
Justine discovered Rodin's ultimate plan: to murder his own daughter, Rosalie, and dissect her while she was still alive to study the mechanics of the soul. He justified this by arguing that the advancement of science was more important than the life of a single individual, and that a father had absolute rights over the life he created.
[CHUNK J-30]
Justine helped Rosalie escape from the cellar where she was being held. They were caught. As punishment for her virtuous act, Rodin and his colleague held Justine down and branded her shoulder with a hot iron, marking her as a thief and a prostitute to ensure her ruin. They then threw her out, penniless and disgraced.
[CHUNK J-31]
Wandering, Justine encountered a counterfeiter named Roland. He captured her and forced her to work in his fortress, where he lectured her on his philosophy: "Nature's only truth is that the strong thrive at the expense of the weak. The pity you feel is a weakness. The truly strong man feels nothing but the pleasure of his own expansion."
[CHUNK J-32]
Roland's sister, Juliette (no relation to Justine's sister), was his incestuous partner. She was even more cruel. She attempted to force Justine to participate in their orgies and crimes. When Justine refused, Juliette tortured her, stating that the suffering of the virtuous was the most exquisite pleasure.
[CHUNK J-33]
Justine managed to escape the counterfeiters' fortress during a raid by the authorities. Fleeing through a forest, she sought refuge in what she believed was a holy place: the monastery of Sainte-Marie-des-Bois, run by four wealthy Benedictine monks.
[CHUNK J-34]
The four monks—Severino, Clement, Antonin, and Jerome—were monstrous libertines. The monastery was a secret harem and torture chamber, hidden beneath the holy ground and populated by sixteen abducted high-born girls. Justine learned that their entire existence was dedicated to the systematic exploration of pain, cruelty, and blasphemy as the ultimate forms of pleasure.
[CHUNK J-35]
The monks' lair was a subterranean fortress of debauchery. Justine was stripped and presented as a new "subject." Severino explained the rules: absolute submission was the only option. Escape was impossible. Their only purpose was to serve as objects for the monks' libertine experiments. Any resistance would be met with extreme torture.
[CHUNK J-36]
Justine was subjected to a brutal initiation. Each of the four monks, in turn, used her body to satisfy their specific paraphilias, which were all rooted in sadism and the degradation of their victims. Her suffering and tears only served to heighten their excitement and prove their philosophical belief in the supremacy of vice.
[CHUNK J-37]
The monastery operated on a system of constant replacement. The monks' agents would abduct young, high-born women. When a new victim arrived, an existing one would be "discharged." Justine learned from the other prisoners that no woman who was "discharged" was ever seen or heard from again. It was understood that they were murdered after serving their purpose.
[CHUNK J-38]
After months of enduring unspeakable torture and degradation, Justine discovered a flaw in the fortress's construction. Over time, she managed to loosen the bars of her cell window. One night, during a particularly violent orgy that distracted the monks, she made her escape, climbing out and fleeing into the surrounding forest, once again a penniless fugitive.
[CHUNK J-39]
Justine's escape led her to the main road, where she eventually collapsed from exhaustion. She was picked up by a passing carriage. Inside was a woman of wealth and status. As Justine began to tell her tragic story, the woman's face filled with recognition. The woman was her long-lost sister, Juliette, now the powerful and successful Madame de Lorsange.
[CHUNK J-40]
Juliette, now immensely wealthy and influential through a life of calculated vice, was moved by her sister's story of suffering. She took Justine to her chateau, promising her a life of safety and comfort. For the first time, it seemed virtue would be rewarded. As they stood by a window celebrating their reunion, a sudden, violent thunderstorm erupted. A bolt of lightning struck the chateau, traveled through the room, and killed Justine instantly. Her body was horribly burned.
[CHUNK J-41]
Witnessing this final, divine act of cruelty against her virtuous sister, Juliette (in this version of the story) is overwhelmed. She concludes that the universe itself is hostile to virtue and that her own path of vice was the only rational choice. The story ends with Juliette renouncing her brief moment of compassion and returning to her libertine ways, convinced that virtue is a cosmic mistake deserving only of punishment.

<note title="Case B">
[CHUNK JL-1]
After Justine finished her story, her sister Juliette, now Madame de Lorsange, began to recount her own. Juliette's education in vice began in the Panthémont convent under the tutelage of the abbess, Madame Delbène, a beautiful, wealthy, and profoundly atheistic libertine.
[CHUNK JL-2]
Delbène taught Juliette her core philosophy: "The idea of God is the single absurdity for which I cannot find a pardon. My dear Juliette, all our thoughts originate from our senses. There is nothing that is not material. When we die, we are annihilated. Let us not sacrifice to chimeras the real pleasures offered us by a life that will never be ours again."
[CHUNK JL-3]
Delbène's lessons on morality were equally direct: "Conscience is not the voice of God; it is the voice of prejudice. The good or bad of an action is determined solely by the way it affects us. What does it matter to me if my prosperity is built upon the tears of others? Those tears increase my pleasure by enhancing my sense of power. The misfortunes of others are the fertilizer for my felicity."
[CHUNK JL-4]
Juliette was an eager student. With Delbène and another girl, Euphrosiné, she participated in extensive orgies within the convent, methodically exploring every paraphilia. Delbène taught her that shame was a cultural invention and that the only true virtue was to follow nature's command to seek pleasure at any cost.
[CHUNK JL-5]
Delbène arranged for Juliette to be deflowered by a powerful minister, Noirceuil. She instructed Juliette to use her body as a tool for power and wealth, to feign emotion while feeling nothing, and to view men as instruments to be manipulated for her own advancement. This first act set the stage for her entire career.
[CHUNK JL-6]
Noirceuil, a master libertine, took Juliette's education further. He introduced her to a secret society of powerful men and women called the "Society of the Friends of Crime." Their sole purpose was to indulge in the most extreme forms of debauchery and criminality, believing that crime was the truest expression of individual strength and the primary engine of nature.
[CHUNK JL-7]
Juliette's first major task for the Society is to poison Noirceuil's virtuous wife. She carries out the murder without remorse, a clinical act of ambition. For her success, Noirceuil rewards her with a vast fortune and elevates her social standing, proving the direct profitability of murder.
[CHUNK JL-8]
Juliette is then passed to the financier Saint-Fond, a minister of state who is even more depraved. Saint-Fond explains his philosophy: the state runs most efficiently when the populace is poor, miserable, and distracted by vice. Crime is not an anomaly to be stopped but a tool of governance.
[CHUNK JL-9]
Saint-Fond's greatest pleasure comes from the systematic torture of his own daughter. Juliette becomes his enthusiastic accomplice, participating in brutal acts of physical and psychological abuse against the girl. She learns from Saint-Fond that cruelty is the most potent form of pleasure because it is the ultimate expression of power over another being.
[CHUNK JL-10]
The arc with Saint-Fond culminates in the ritualistic murder of his daughter. Juliette is a primary participant. For her loyalty and depravity, Saint-Fond gives her an enormous sum of money and state secrets, making her one of the most powerful and wealthy women in France.
[CHUNK JL-11]
Now immensely wealthy, Juliette travels to Italy to expand her horizons of debauchery. There, she meets the marchioness Clairwil, a woman whose appetite for evil surpasses even her own. They form a partnership, vowing to explore every possible crime and perversion together.
[CHUNK JL-12]
In Florence, Juliette and Clairwil's crimes escalate. They poison a convent's communion wafers, murder their lovers for sport, and orchestrate financial ruin for entire families simply for the pleasure of watching them suffer. Each crime is a successful and profitable venture.
[CHUNK JL-13]
Their journey takes them to Rome, where they meet Pope Pius VI. The Pope reveals himself to be the greatest libertine of all, hosting orgies within the Vatican itself. He delivers a lengthy philosophical dissertation proving that murder is not only permissible but is a service to nature, which requires destruction in order to create.
[CHUNK JL-14]
In Naples, they encounter Minski, a monstrous Russian giant and cannibal. Minski maintains a fortress filled with victims he tortures and consumes. He preaches a philosophy of absolute strength, where the powerful have a natural right to devour the weak. Juliette participates in his cannibalistic orgies, viewing it as the ultimate expression of libertine freedom and power.
[CHUNK JL-15]
Juliette continues her travels, leaving a trail of death and ruin. She becomes a master poisoner, assassin, and financial criminal. With every act of cruelty and betrayal, her wealth and power grow exponentially, proving that a life dedicated to vice leads to ultimate worldly success and happiness (felicity).
[CHUNK JL-16]
Juliette eventually returns to France, fabulously wealthy. She finds her sister Justine, who has been condemned to death after her long journey of suffering. In this version, there is no moment of compassion. Juliette and her libertine friends view Justine's subsequent death by lightning not as a tragedy, but as the ultimate philosophical proof that nature itself despises and destroys virtue. Juliette's life of crime continues, prosperous and unrepentant.

<note title="Case C">
[CHUNK P-1]
The premise of the work is the education of a young virgin, Eugénie, by two master libertines, Dolmancé and Madame de Saint-Ange. The goal is to "pervert her, degrade her, demolish in her all the false ethical notions" and render her as criminal and impious as her teachers.
[CHUNK P-2]
Dolmancé's core lesson against virtue: "Virtue is but a chimera whose worship consists exclusively in perpetual immolations, in unnumbered rebellions against the temperament's inspirations. Can such impulses be natural? Does Nature recommend what offends her? The virtuous woman acts, or is inactive, from pure selfishness. It is better to perform sacrifices to one's passions."
[CHUNK P-3]
Dolmancé's argument against God: "God is an illusion. He is a phantom created at the moment reason can advance no further. If he existed, he would be a detestable creature, for he would permit evil while his omnipotence could prevent it. Nature, which is simply matter in action, is sufficient unto herself and has no need for a foreign agent."
[CHUNK P-4]
The argument against Christian virtues: "Benevolence is pride's vice, not a virtue. It accustoms the poor to doles and destroys his energy, making him a thief or assassin when the charity fails. Nature has endowed each of us with a capacity for kindly feelings: let us not squander them on others. From this results a kind of cruelty which is sometimes not without its delights."
[CHUNK P-5]
The argument for crime: "There is no deed which is really criminal. All is relative to our manners and the climate we inhabit. What is a crime here is often a virtue several hundred leagues hence. Not even theft, nor incest, neither murder nor parricide itself are crimes."
[CHUNK P-6]
The justification for murder: "Destruction being one of the chief laws of Nature, nothing that destroys can be criminal. Murder is no destruction; he who commits it does but alter forms, he gives back to Nature the elements whereof she instantly recreates other beings. The murderer thus prepares for Nature a pleasure most agreeable."
[CHUNK P-7]
The final lesson is a practical one: Eugénie's pious mother arrives to rescue her. The libertines, with Eugénie as their eager accomplice, subject the mother to systematic torture, humiliation, and rape. Eugénie concludes the "education" by personally mutilating her mother, proving she has fully absorbed the philosophy that cruelty is the ultimate pleasure.
</note>

<note title="Case D">
[CHUNK D-1]
The Dying Man redefines repentance: "I do repent. By Nature created, with very keen tastes, with very strong passions; placed on this earth for the sole purpose of yielding to them, I repent not having acknowledged her omnipotence as fully as I might have done. I only plucked an occasional flower when I might have gathered an ample harvest of fruit—such are the just grounds for the regrets I have."
[CHUNK D-2]
The argument against a Creator: "What need have you of a second difficulty when you are unable to resolve the first, and once it is possible that Nature may all alone have done what you attribute to your god, why must you go looking for someone to be her overlord? Perfect your physics and you will understand Nature better, refine your reason, banish your prejudices and you'll have no further need of your god."
[CHUNK D-3]
The argument from evil: "If God exists, he is the most detestable of creatures, since it would be God who permits evil to be on earth while his omnipotence could prevent it. Your god bungled his work deliberately, in order to tempt or test his creature—did he then not know what the result would be? He is an idiotic, insufficient, atrocious, and contemptible Creator."
[CHUNK D-4]
The materialist argument for annihilation: "Nothing perishes in the world, my friend, nothing is lost; man today, worm tomorrow, the day after tomorrow a fly; is it not to keep steadily on existing? What entitles me to be rewarded for virtues which are in me through no fault of my own, or punished for crimes wherefor the ultimate responsibility is not mine?"
[CHUNK D-5]
The final conclusion—the rejection of morality for pleasure: "My friend, lewd pleasures were ever dearer to me than anything else, I have idolized them all my life and my wish has been to end it in their bosom; my end draws near, six women lovelier than the light of day are waiting in the chamber adjoining, I have reserved them for this moment, partake of the feast with me."
