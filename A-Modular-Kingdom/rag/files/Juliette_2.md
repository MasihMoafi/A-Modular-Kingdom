  <discourse title="On the Inutility of Virtue and the Abolition of Marriage">
    <p>
      I was struck by, and must not fail to mention, this: the extreme solicitude shown for the pensionnaires’ maidenheads... I could not understand why they whose portion was not to be the cloister, but life in the world, were treated with such consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Their honor resides therein,” Delbène explained to me when I questioned her about the thing. “We do, by all means, wish to amuse ourselves with these girls; but why ruin them? Why cause them to detest the memory of the moments they passed in our midst? No, we have that virtue, and however corrupt you suppose us to be, we never compromise our friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I found these measures and these ethics proper; but, created by Nature someday to attain an excellence in base villainy superior to anything I was to encounter, the desire to sully and peradventure to doom one of my companions rose up strong in my brain as of this same instant—this desire was at least as imperious as that other I had to be degraded myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do declare,” were Delbène’s next words... “in this world I wonder at nothing so much as at the moral education girls are commonly given. It would appear as if its one aim were to instill notions and doctrines that contradict all the natural impulses in our maidens. Is anyone able to tell me, for I sincerely wish to know, of what use a prudent, well-behaved woman can be to society? and whether there is anything more superfluous than the practice of this virtue which, with every passing day, only further numbs and mines our sex? We women exist in two situations wherein these practices are recommended to us; I am going to undertake to prove that, in either phase of a woman’s life, they are of the most thorough inutility.”

      “Up until the time a girl marries, of what conceivable advantage can preserving her virginity be to her? And how can folly be carried to the point where one believes a female creature is worth more or less for having one part of her body a little more or a little less enlarged? For what purpose has Nature created every human being? Is it not for giving mutual aid one to the other, and consequently for giving others all the pleasures it is in one’s power to dispense? Well, if it be true that a man may expect very great pleasures from a young girl, do you not fly in the face of Nature’s intentions and laws when you saddle this poor little thing with a ferocious virtue that forbids her from lending herself to this man’s impetuous desires? Can you allow such barbarity without advancing some justification for it? And what justification are you going to propose in order to convince me that the child in question does well by remaining a virgin? Your religion, your customs, your habits? And, I ask you, what baser drivel, what more contemptible arguments can you find?”
    </p>

      “Shall we now investigate the necessity of virtue in women whose situation is that of a wife? The matter is now one of adultery, I should like to go thoroughly into this popularly alleged misdemeanor. Our customs, manners, religious beliefs, codes, regulations—all these sordid local factors merit no consideration in this survey; the point is not to discover whether adultery is a crime in the eyes of the Laplander who permits it, or of the Frenchman who hammers it, but to make out whether humanity is wronged or Nature offended by this act. In order to entertain such a hypothesis, one must first be in total ignorance of the scope of the physical desires with which the common mother of mankind has endowed both sexes. Obviously, if one man were sufficient to a single woman’s desires, or if one woman could appease the ardors of any single man, then, within the framework of this hypothesis, whosoever violated the law would also outrage Nature. But if the fickleness and the insatiability of these desires are such that more than one man is necessary to women as an abundance of women is to men, you will, I presume, concede that, such being the case, whatever law opposes their desires is tyrannical and plainly at daggers drawn with Nature.”
    </p>

      “The pseudo-virtue called chastity... being the idol which dread of adultery makes us worship, every sane mind ought first of all to give chastity an eminent position amongst the most odious devices whereby man has seen fit to encumber and rout the inspirations of Nature. Let’s probe to the heart of the matter: the importance of the need to fuck is no less high than our need to eat and drink, and one ought to indulge in them all with equal unrestraint. Modesty... was originally designed as nothing but a stimulant to lust... and fools subsequently took for a virtue what was merely a contrivance of libertinage. It is as ridiculous to pretend that chastity is a virtue as it would be to assert that it is a virtue to deprive oneself of food.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ponder the matter and you’ll discover that there has never been any other cause for all our difficulties. One power, quietly gathering strength, has always ended up trying to overwhelm the other, and has always succeeded. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, my friends: abolish marriages. Away with those abhorrent chains; enough of these bitter regrets; no more of these hardships, these crimes, the consequences of these monstrous abuses, you’ll be rid of them all the day you’re done with these laws: for laws alone create the crime; and the crime is gone as soon as the law ceases to exist.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We begin by establishing a fact which we are prone to consider incontrovertible: that, during the carnal act, extremely little thought is devoted to the creature which may be its result... It is erroneous that propagation is supposed to be one of Nature’s laws, if we imagine such nonsense our pride alone is to blame. Nature permits propagation, but one must take care not to mistake her tolerance for an enjoinder. Nature stands in not the slightest need of propagation; and the total disappearance of mankind... would grieve her very little... Thus, we no more serve Nature in reproducing ourselves than we offend her in not doing so.”

  <discourse title="A Systematic Deconstruction of God and the Soul">
    <introduction>
      "I fear,” said she, “lest you proceed in too great haste, my child. Your heart, beguiled by your mind, has not yet reached the stage at which I would prefer to see it. These superstitious infamies are still harassing you—I wager ’tis so. Listen to me, Juliette, lend me your undivided attention and make an effort so that in the future, with an effrontery equal to mine and without any qualms whatever, you will be able to carry your libertinage, anchored upon a substructure of reliable principles, to it matters not what extreme."
    </introduction>

    <argument_section topic="The Existence of God">
      <premise id="1" title="God as a Product of Ignorance">
        <p>"When they begin to chatter about religion, the first of the dogmas they trundle forth is the one pertaining to the existence of God: as it is the foundation of the whole edifice, I ought logically to begin my examination by focusing upon it."</p>
        <p>"Oh, Juliette! let us have no doubt, this fantasy about there being a God has its origins in nothing but the mind’s limitations. Knowing not to whom or what all the universe about us is to be attributed, helpless before the utter impossibility of explaining the inscrutable mysteries of Nature, above her we have gratuitously installed a Being invested with the power of producing all the effects of whose causes we are profoundly ignorant."</p>
      </premise>
      <premise id="2" title="The Fallacy of 'Objective' vs. 'Real' Existence">
        <p>"Behold it, Juliette: such is the God men have got themselves; behold what their enervated imaginations have spawned by way of a grotesque fantasy... you recognize that this grandiose phantom, having a merely objective existence, cannot exist anywhere outside the minds of the deluded who rivet their hallucinated attentions upon it, and hence it amounts to no more than the pure and simple effect of their brains’ heated disorder."</p>
      </premise>
      <argument id="1" title="Critique of Holy Texts and Revelations">
        <p>"After devoting a rapid glance to the absurd ideas entertained upon this subject by all the peoples of the earth, I finally arrive at the doctrines espoused by the Jews and Christians... what am I to think when I cannot avoid remarking, as I inspect them, that not only could they never have been dictated by the mind or spirit of a God, but that forsooth they were written down long after the death of the personage who dares affirm he transmitted verbatim God’s own phrases... And now let’s have a glance at the Christians. And what a host of further absurdities we have here! ...This Christ, is he the lawgiver we’re to hearken to? ...So, Juliette, it is apparent, is it not, the vicious circle into which men fall as soon as they begin to rave about this rubbish: religion proves its prophet, the prophet his religion."</p>
      </argument>
      <argument id="2" title="The Logical Contradictions of an Omnipotent Being">
        <p>"But, with a cool head, let’s proceed and, if you like, momentarily grant our antagonists the existence of the vampire that is the author of their felicity. Within this hypothesis, I ask them whether the law... whereby God supervises beings is of the same nature as our mortal will... If he is subject to a law, his function is merely executive; if this be so, he follows instructions and is not autonomous... If, on the other hand, this superior being can change his sentiments and his will, I wish to know why he does so... can we possibly imagine this motive without lessening the perfection of the being who cedes to it? ...And so even were they to bring off their demonstration... nothing could prove to me that I please him by observing his commandments, for if he is not good he can deceive me, and my reason, which comes to me only from him, shall not be my guarantee..."</p>
      </argument>
      <conclusion title="Rejection of the Deific System">
        <p>"We may declare it truthfully and with confidence: of all the religions edified by mankind, there is not one which can make any legitimate claim to pre-eminence over the rest... ‘But,’ I interjected at this point, ‘if there be neither God nor religion, what is it runs the universe?’ ‘My dear,’ Madame Delbène replied, ‘the universe runs itself, and the eternal laws inherent in Nature suffice... the perpetual movement of matter explains everything: why need we supply a motor to that which is ever in motion?’"</p>
      </conclusion>
    </argument_section>

    <argument_section topic="The Nature of the Soul">
      <premise id="1" title="The Soul as a Physical Construct">
        <p>"After having demonstrated the complete extravagance of the deific system, I’ll surely have little trouble uprooting the prejudices... on the principle of life; is there really anything more extraordinary than this superiority to animals which humans arrogate to themselves? Ask them upon what basis their superiority rests. ‘We have a soul’—that’s their silly response. Then ask them to explain what they mean... ‘It is an unknown substance,’ they begin; next: it’s a secret incorporeal power; finally, a spirit whereof they have no definite idea."</p>
      </premise>
      <argument id="1" title="Critique of Dualism (Mind/Body Problem)">
        <p>"To that nonsense I have just this to reply: if the soul is a substance that differs essentially from the body and that can have no relation to it, their fusion is impossible. Furthermore, this soul, being in essence different from the body, ought necessarily to act in a different fashion from it; however, we observe that the impulses experienced by the body make themselves felt also upon this so-called soul, and that these two substances, dissimilar in essence, always act in concert."</p>
      </argument>
      <argument id="2" title="Refutation of Immortality">
        <p>"If I ask them their motives for supposing the soul deathless, they pipe up at once: ‘Because it is in man’s very nature to desire eternal life.’ ‘But,’ I reply, ‘does your desire become proof of its fulfillment? By what peculiar logic dare one decide that something cannot fail to happen because one wishes it to?’... Oh, my beloved friend, doubt thereof there may be none: when we die, we die. Inside and out, through and through..."</p>
      </argument>
      <argument id="3" title="Proof of Materiality via Syllogism">
        <p>"The soul—or, if you wish, the active principle that animates, moves, determines us—is nothing other than matter subtilized... we may prove its materiality by two irrefutable syllogisms. (1) As active principle it is divisible... whatever is susceptible of division is material. The soul, beheld as active principle, is divisible, hence material. (2) Whatever is susceptible of structural degeneration is material... the soul is affected by the condition of the body... the soul declines and hence it is material."</p>
      </argument>
      <conclusion title="Rejection of the Afterlife">
        <p>"Enthusiasm or madness alone can make one reject a lucid and reassuring system and cleave to one where improbable conjectures make one despair... ‘But what shall become of me?’ I demanded of Madame Delbène. ‘I am afraid of this darkness, this eternal annihilation scares me.’ ‘And, pray tell, what were you before birth?’ inquired that brilliant woman... ‘La la, calm yourself, my pigeon; the cessation of being affrights only the imagination that has created the execrable dogma of an afterlife.’"</p>
      </conclusion>
    </argument_section>
    
    <final_exhortation title="The Embrace of Natural Law">
      <p>"Oh, Juliette, you’re going to think me peremptory, somewhat the rebel and an enemy of yokes and handcuffs; but with uncompromising severity I am going to dismiss this equally absurd and childish obligation which enjoins us not to do unto others that which unto us we would not have done. It is the precise contrary Nature recommends, since Nature’s single precept is to enjoy oneself, at the expense of no matter whom."</p>
